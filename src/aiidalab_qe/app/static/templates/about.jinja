      The Quantum ESPRESSO app (or QE app for short) is a graphical front end for calculating materials properties using
      <a href="https://www.quantum-espresso.org/" target="_blank">Quantum ESPRESSO</a> (QE).
      Each property is calculated by workflows powered by the <a href="https://www.aiida.net/" target="_bland">AiiDA</a>
      engine, and maintained in the <a href="https://aiida-quantumespresso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
        target="_blank">aiida-quantumespresso</a> plugin and many other plugins developed by the AiiDA community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The QE app allows you to calculate properties in a simple 4-step process:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        üîç <strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the structure you want to run.
      </li>
      <li>
        ‚öôÔ∏è <strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the properties you are interested in.
      </li>
      <li>
        üíª <strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the computational resources you want to run on and submit your workflow.
      </li>
      <li>
        üöÄ <strong>Step 4:</strong> Monitor and view your workflow results.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      New users can go straight to the first step and select their structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Completed workflows can be viewed in the <strong>Calculation history</strong> section.
