    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    Antiferromagnetic calculations require to define a starting magnetization with opposite sign for atoms of the same chemical element.
    In this example, we will consider cobalt oxide (CoO) and the antiferromagnetic moments are on cobalt. However,
    the unit cell of CoO only has 2 atoms (1 Co and 1 O). Therefore, we need to perform two steps before submission:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a supercell to contain at least 2 Co atoms (we will create a 1x1x2 supercell), so that there are
        two Co atoms in the simulation cell
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign different species (i.e., give a different “name”) to the two Co atoms.
        Follow the steps below to achieve this goal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Click on the <b>From examples</b> tab</li>
      <li>Click on <b>Simple crystals</b></li>
      <li>Select <b>Cobalt oxide</b> from the dropdown list</li>
      <li>Click on the <b>Edit structure</b> panel and open the <b>Edit cell</b> tab.
        Set the matrix element (3, 3) to the value of 2 and click <b>Apply transformation</b> to double the unit cell
        along the third periodic direction (1 x 1 x 2 supercell). <b>Note:</b> click the <b>Apply transformation</b> button only once!
        Inspect the structure in the <b>View structure</b> panel and verify that you now have 4 atoms in the unit cell.
      </li>
      <li>Switch to the <b>Edit atom tags</b> tab.</li>
      <li>
        We now want to assign the two Co atoms to two new species <b>Co1</b> and <b>Co2</b> (rather than the same <b>Co</b> species).
        This will allow us, later, to set different starting magnetization for them (e.g. spin down for <b>Co1</b> and up for <b>Co2</b>).
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the 3D structure visualizer, click on the <b>Co</b> atom at the corner of the unit cell to select it: it will turn green.
            In the <b>Edit atom tags</b> tab, press the <b>From Selection</b> button to automatically insert the index of that atom in
            the text box.
            Set the tag to the value 1 and press the <b>Update tags</b> button to apply the change: now atom will be assigned to species <b>Co1</b>.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat the previous step for spin-up, but this time, select the other <b>Co</b>
            atom and set the tag to <b>2</b>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to double check the tags that you assigned, you can type “1..4” in the “Index of atoms” textbox to show all four atoms.
        You should verify that the two Co atoms have different tags, while oxygens have no tag.
        (Note that the table is scrollable, by default you see only the first few rows).

    In the submission step, we define the computational resources to be used in
    the calculations. The global resources are used to define resources across
    all workflow calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource
    settings for specific calculations.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo
    server), we recommend keeping nodes and CPUs at the default minimum of 1
    each.

  <p>
    Once the resources are defined, we can optionally customize the workflow
    label (pre-filled according to the settings of steps 1 & 2), as well as
    provide a detailed description of the workflow. Once we are ready, we can
    submit the workflow.

    You first need to select which code (code executable + computer where this
    will run) to use for each step of the workflow. The Quantum ESPRESSO app
    should always install a local Quantum ESPRESSO executable that is sufficient
    for this tutorial, but you can setup additional codes installed on remote
    supercomputers. For more information on how to set up codes, please refer to the

      Use the app to compute the antiferromagnetic band structure.
      <ul>
        <li>Follow the same steps as before, but this time, select the electronic
          band structure in the <b>Configure workflow panel</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also check both boxes to calculate the PDOS and band structure (and, in the
          advanced band structure options, turn on <b>Fat bands</b>).
          This will allow you to plot so called fat-bands, showing the orbital character
          of the bands.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Compare the antiferromagnetic results with the ferromagnetic example discussed in the corresponding <b>Ferromagnetism & DFT+U</b> in-app guide.
      <ul>
        <li>
          This time, you do not need to set the tags.
        </li>
        <li>Set the initial magnetic moments to the same values as before.</li>
        <li>Finally, compare your FM PDOS with the AFM one obtained before.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      As mentioned in the <b>Advanced settings</b>, consider to rerun the antiferromagnetic PDOS with a Hubbard U correction to see
      how the electronic structure changes in case of the antiferromagnetic configuration.
