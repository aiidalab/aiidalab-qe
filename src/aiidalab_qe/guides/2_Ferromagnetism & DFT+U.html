  In this guide, you will learn how to model ferromagnetic materials and how to
  include Hubbard U corrections in your calculations. In this example, you will investigate the CoO structure.

  Here we select the properties to calculate. Each property is associated with a

  since this will enable an understanding of the impact of the Hubbard U and which electronic
  states contribute to the magnetism.

    <h5>Setup ferromagnetism</h5>
    When <b>Magnetism</b> is activated, the <b>Magnetization</b> subsection appears below.
    In this tutorial, you will set the <b>Initial magnetic moments</b> of the different elements.
    <b>Note:</b> In general, it is also possible to set the <b>Total magnetization</b> instead.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set the initial magnetic moments (replacing the default ones) of <b>Co</b> to <b>3 &mu;<sub>B</sub></b> and <b>O</b>
        to <b>0.6 &mu;<sub>B</sub></b>.

    <h5>Setup DFT+U</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Enable Hubbard-U corrections by activating the <b>Define U values</b> checkbox.</li>
      <li>Define the U values for the different elements. Set U for <b>Co - 3d</b> to <b>6 eV</b> (we do not apply a U correction to O).</li>

    In the submission step, we define the computational resources to be used in
    the calculations. The global resources are used to define resources across
    all workflow calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource
    settings for specific calculations.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo
    server), we recommend keeping nodes and CPUs at the default minimum of 1

  <p>
    Once the resources are defined, we can optionally customize the workflow
    label (pre-filled according to the settings of steps 1 & 2), as well as
    provide a detailed description of the workflow. Once we are ready, we can
    submit the workflow.

  <ol>
        <li>Follow the steps in the guide again, but this time, unset the Hubbard U or set it to 0. What do you notice?
          What happens to the electronic states around the Fermi level?
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Optionally:</b> Follow the same steps as before, but this time, choose a different U value.
        Inspect the results and see how the U values influence the electronic structure.
