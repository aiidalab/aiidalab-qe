<div id="guide-header">
  You've activated the basic in-app guide. In this guide, you will learn how to
  use the app to build and submit a workflow of Quantum ESPRESSO calculations
  designed to compute the electronic structure of bulk gold. Click on
  <b>Step 1: Select structure</b> and follow the instructions to proceed.
</div>

<div id="structure-step">
  In the structure selection step, we select a structure for the calculation in
  one of several ways:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Upload file</b>: upload a structure file from your computer</li>
    <li><b>OPTIMADE</b>: search for structures in any <a href="https://optimade.org" target="_blank">OPTIMADE</a>-compliant online database</li>
    <li><b>AiiDA database</b>: search for structures in your local AiiDA database</li>
    <li>
      <b>From Examples</b>: select a structure from a list of example structures
    </li>
  </ul>
  Once selected, we can view the structure in the viewer below. We can also edit
  the structure using the available structure editors. When done, we can choose
  to modify the structure label and/or provide a description.
  These will be attached to the input structure in your AiiDA database.
  <br />
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    In this first tutorial, we will compute use a gold structure, selecting it from the examples that we provide.
    <ol>
      <li>Click on the <b>From examples</b> tab</li>
      <li>Click on <b>Simple crystals</b></li>
      <li>Select <b>Gold</b> from the dropdown list</li>
      <li>Click the <b>Confirm</b> button to proceed</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
      <b>Warning:</b> If the confirmed structure is not yet stored in the AiiDA
      database, it will be stored automatically when you proceed to the next
      step.

      <b>Warning:</b> Changes after confirmation will reset the following steps.

</div>

<div id="configuration-step">
  In this second step (Configure workflow), we define the workflow tasks, such as optimizing
  the structure geometry and/or computing certain properties. We also select in
  this step the parameters for the workflow calculations.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Select <b>Full geometry</b> relaxation</li>
      <li>Open <b>step 2.1</b> for further instructions</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="properties-selection">
  Here we select the properties to calculate. Each property is associated with a
  workflow that will submit one or more calculations.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Check (activate) <b>Electronic band structure</b></li>
      <li>Check (activate) <b>Electronic projected density of states (PDOS)</b></li>
      <li>Open <b>step 2.2</b> for further instructions</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="calculation-settings">
  Here we can customize the calculation parameters.
  The settings are divided into several tabs.
  Two tabs are always present:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Basic settings</b>: top-level calculation settings</li>
    <li><b>Advanced settings</b>: fine-tune the calculations</li>
  </ul>
  Additionally, each plugin activated in the previous step 2.1 can add additional tabs.
  If we activated the two checkboxes in step 2.1, we should also see the two tabs "Band Structure" and "PDOS".

  Note that the app pre-configures defaults for most parameters.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    See further instructions in the <b>Basic settings</b> panel below.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="basic-settings">
  The basic settings panel provides top-level calculation settings including the
  electronic and magnetic properties of the material, and if spin-orbit coupling
  is to be considered. It also provides a choice of three protocols that
  pre-configure many calculation settings, balancing speed with precision.
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Note:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo server),
    we recommend selecting the <b>fast</b> protocol to reduce the computational
    cost and avoid crashes due to insufficient resources.
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the <b>Fast</b> protocol</li>

<div id="submission-step">
  <p>
    In the submission step, we define the computational resources to be used in
    the calculations. The global resources are used to define resources across
    all workflow calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource
    settings for specific calculations.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo
    server), we recommend keeping nodes and CPUs at the default minimum of 1
    each.
  </div>
  <p>
    Once the resources are defined, we can optionally customize the workflow
    label (pre-filled according to the settings of steps 1 & 2), as well as
    provide a detailed description of the workflow. Once we are ready, we can
    submit the workflow.

    You first need to select which code (code executable + computer where this
    will run) to use for each step of the workflow. The Quantum ESPRESSO app
    should always install a local Quantum ESPRESSO executable that is sufficient
    for this tutorial, but you can setup additional codes installed on remote
    supercomputers. For more information on how to set up codes, please refer to the
    corresponding

  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Check that the the default options in the "Global resources" panel are the expected ones.
        Specifically: select 1 node and 1 CPU for each of the codes. Unless you want to run elsewhere,
        use the default codes on the AiiDAlab server (ending with `@localhost`)
        that are available from the dropdown menus.</li>
      <li><b>(Optional)</b> customize the workflow label</li>

<div id="results-step">
  Below you can monitor the status of the calculation, that might take
  several minutes to conclude even if we are using the fast protocol.
  A summary of calculation parameters is also provided. Raw input and output files
  may be downloaded upon workflow completion, as well as an AiiDA archive containing
  the full calculation provenance (that can be reimported by other AiiDAlab users and
  allows to reload the calculation).

      <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <b>Note:</b> You may see more than one structure relaxation workflows,
        with the first one(s) possibly marked with ❌. This is expected. Due to
        the fast protocol, convergence may not be reached in the first attempt,
        prompting the workflow to run a final relaxation step. The final step
        should be marked with a ✅.

  In the structure results panel, we can view the initial structure selected for
  the calculation. The panel is mostly the same as the one we saw in the
  structure selection step, with the notable additions of the structure node
  info and structure coordinates table. Most importantly, once structure
  relaxation is complete, the toggle button below the title will become active
  and allow us to switch between the initial and relaxed structure.
