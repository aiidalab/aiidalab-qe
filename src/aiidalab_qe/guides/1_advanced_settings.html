  You've activated the advanced settings in-app guide. In this guide, you will learn how 
  to tune more advanced settings of the workflows. Those settings include k-points, 
  pseudopotentials and more.

  The advanced settings panel can be used to fine-tune the calculation
  parameters such as convergence thresholds, k-points, etc.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <h5>This is just an outline of potential parameters that you could tune to see their impact.
      You do not need to change all of them.
    </h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set the <b>SCF</b> threshold to <b>1e-05 Ry/atom</b>. You will realize that your
        calculation is much faster but it will not be properly converged.
        <br>You could calculate the electronic structure and compare it to a calculation 
        with stricter convergence criteria.
      </li>
      <li>When changing the <b>K-points distance</b>, see definition below, you immediately 
        see the resulting k-mesh. Similar to the convergence threshold before, increasing the 
        distance will impact the convergence of your calculation.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <b>Accuracy and precision</b> section, you can select the pseudo potentials.
        We recommended the SSSP ones, a library of tested pseudo potentials that we are maintaining. However,
        spin-orbit calculations require fully relativistic pseudopotentials. In this case, you could use the
        Pseudo-Dojo library.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can choose between <b>PBE</b> and <b>PBEsol</b> functional.
        You can switch between the two and do a structural relaxation and see the impact on
        the lattice constant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, you can also change the cutoffs for the wavefunctions and the charge density 
        in the <b>Pseudopotentials</b> subsection. Similar to the <b>K-points</b> above, this will affect 
        computational cost and convergence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the <b>PDOS</b> tab for further examples.
      </li>
    </ol>

<div id="pdos-settings">
  Here you can set property specific settings.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <ol>
      <li>
        Similar to the <b>K-points distance</b> of the <b>SCF</b> calculation, 
        you can also adjust the <b>K-points distance</b> of the <b>NSCF</b> calculation, 
        which should be denser (i.e., smaller distance value).
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also tune the energy grid size for the <b>PDOS</b> and the broadening width.
      </li>
    </ol>

<div id="submission-step">
  <p>
    In the submission step, we define the computational resources to be used in
    the calculations. The global resources are used to define resources across
    all workflow calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource
    settings for specific calculations.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo
    server), we recommend keeping nodes and CPUs at the default minimum of 1
    each.

  <p>
    Once the resources are defined, we can optionally customize the workflow
    label (pre-filled according to the settings of steps 1 & 2), as well as
    provide a detailed description of the workflow. Once we are ready, we can
    submit the workflow.
