<div id="guide-header">
  You've activated the basic in-app guide. In this guide, you will learn how to
  use the app to build and submit a workflow of Quantum ESPRESSO calculations
  designed to compute the electronic structure of bulk gold. Click on
  <b>Step 1: Select structure</b> and follow the instructions to proceed.
</div>

<div id="structure-step">
  In the structure selection step, we select a structure for the calculation in
  one of a several ways:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Upload file</b>: upload a structure file from your computer</li>
    <li><b>OPTIMADE</b>: search for structures in the OPTIMADE database</li>
    <li><b>AiiDA database</b>: search for structures in your AiiDA database</li>
    <li>
      <b>From Examples</b>: select a structure from a list of example structures
    </li>
  </ul>
  Once selected, we can view the structure in the viewer below. We can also edit
  the structure using the available structure editors. When done, we can choose
  to modify the structure label and/or provide a description. These will be
  attached to the input structure node in your AiiDA database.

</div>

<div id="configuration-step">
  In the configuration step, we define the workflow tasks, such as optimizing
  the structure geometry and/or computing certain properties. We also select in
  this step the parameters for the workflow calculations.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Select <b>Full geometry</b> relaxation</li>
      <li>Open <b>step 2.1</b> for further instructions</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="properties-selection">
  Here we select the properties to calculate. Each property is associated with a
  workflow that will submit one or more calculations.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Check <b>Electronic band structure</b></li>
      <li>Check <b>Electronic projected density of states (PDOS)</b></li>
      <li>Open <b>step 2.2</b> for further instructions</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="calculation-settings">
  Here we can customize the calculation parameters. The settings are divided
  into several tabs:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Basic settings</b>: top-level calculation settings</li>
    <li><b>Advanced settings</b>: fine-tune the calculations</li>
    <li>
      <b>Plugin settings</b>: parameters for plugin calculations including
      electronic band structure or projected density of states
    </li>
  </ul>
  Note that the app pre-configures defaults for most parameters.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    See further instructions in the <b>Basic settings</b> panel below.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="basic-settings">
  The basic settings panel provides top-level calculation settings including the
  electronic and magnetic properties of the material, and if spin-orbit coupling
  is to be considered. It also provides a choice of three protocols that
  pre-configure many calculation settings, balancing speed with accuracy.
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Note:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo server),
    we recommend selecting the <b>fast</b> protocol to reduce the computational
    cost.
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the <b>fast</b> protocol</li>

        customize them in this tutorial)

<div id="submission-step">
  <p>
    In the submission step, we define the computational resources to be used in
    the calculations. The global resources are used to define resources across
    all workflow calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource
    settings for specific calculations.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo
    server), we recommend keeping nodes and CPUs at the default minimum of 1
    each.
  </div>
  <p>
    Once the resources are defined, we can optionally customize the workflow
    label (pre-filled according to the settings of steps 1 & 2), as well as
    provide a detailed description of the workflow. Once we are ready, we can
    submit the workflow.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Select 1 node and 1 CPU for each of the codes below</li>
      <li><b>(Optional)</b> customize the workflow label</li>
      <li><b>(Optional)</b> add a workflow description</li>
      <li>Click the <b>Submit</b> button to proceed</li>

<div id="results-step">
  In the final step, we can monitor the calculation and view its results. A
  summary of calculation parameters is also provided. Raw input and output files
  may be downloaded upon workflow completion, as well as an AiiDA archive
  containing the full calculation provenance.
  <div class="alert alert-success">

  panel is mostly the same as the one we saw in the structure selection step,
  with the notable additions of the structure node info and structure
  coordinates table.

        If you did so with only one of the two workflows finished, only the
        corresponding checkbox will be active and checked. The other will be
        available once its corresponding workflow finishes. At which point, you
        will be able to replot the data with both sets of results.

      Explore the AiiDA database by viewing the
      <a href="./calculation_history.ipynb" target="_blank">
        calculation history </a

      filter, and sort a table of all calculations stored in the AiiDA database.
      Each entry in the table includes a download feature similar to the
      previous two steps.
