<div id="structure-step">
  In this step, you can select a structure as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Upload file</b>: upload a structure file from your computer.</li>
    <li><b>OPTIMADE</b>: search for structures in the OPTIMADE database.</li>
    <li>
      <b>AiiDA database</b>: search for structures in your AiiDA database.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>From Examples</b>: select a structure from a list of example
      structures.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Once selected, you may inspect the structure. You can also edit the structure
  using the available structure editors. When done, you can choose to modify the
  structure label and/or provide a description. These will be attached to the
  input structure node in your AiiDA database. When you are ready, click
  "Confirm" to proceed to the next step.

<div id="basic-settings">
  The basic settings panel provides top-level calculation settings including the
  electronic and magnetic properties of the material. It also provides a choice
  of three protocols that pre-configure many calculation settings, balancing
  speed with accuracy.
  <div class="alert alert-success">Select the <b>fast</b> protocol</div>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    Note: Due to the limited resources provided for the demo server, we select
    the <b>fast</b> protocol to reduce the cost of the calculation.

<div id="advanced-settings">
  The Advanced settings allow you to finely tune the calculation.

    In this walkthrough, we will not modify advanced settings and proceed with
    the defaults.

<div id="bands-settings">
  Here we configure the settings for computing the band structure.
  <div class="alert alert-success">Check <b>Fat bands calculation</b></div>

<div id="submission-step">
  In this step, we define the resources to be used in the calculation. The
  global resources are used to define resources across all workflow
  calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource settings for specific
  calculations.
