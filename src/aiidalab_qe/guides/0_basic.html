<div id="structure-step">
  In this step, you can select a structure as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Upload file</b>: upload a structure file from your computer.</li>
    <li><b>OPTIMADE</b>: search for structures in the OPTIMADE database.</li>
    <li>
      <b>AiiDA database</b>: search for structures in your AiiDA database.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>From Examples</b>: select a structure from a list of example
      structures.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Once selected, you may inspect the structure. You can also edit the structure
  using the available structure editors. When done, you can choose to modify the
  structure label and/or provide a description. These will be attached to the
  input structure node in your AiiDA database. When you are ready, click
  "Confirm" to proceed to the next step.

  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Click on the <b>From examples</b> tab</li>
      <li>Select <b>Gold</b> from the dropdown list</li>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> If the confirmed structure is not yet stored in the AiiDA
    database, it will be stored automatically when you proceed to the next step.

<div id="configuration-step">
  In this step, we define the workflow tasks, including structure relaxation and
  which properties to compute, and select the parameters of the calculations.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Select <b>Full geometry</b> relaxation</li>
      <li>Open <b>Step 2.1</b> to select properties</li>
      <li>Open <b>Step 2.2</b> to customize parameters</li>
      <li>Click <b>Confirm</b> to proceed</li>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Note:</b> Changes after confirmation will unconfirm this step and reset
    the following steps.

</div>

<div id="properties-selection">
  Here we select the properties to calculate.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    Select <b>Electronic band structure</b> and
    <b>Projected density of states (PDOS)</b>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="calculation-settings">
  Here we can customize the calculation parameters.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    Click on each tab to customize its settings.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="basic-settings">
  The basic settings panel provides top-level calculation settings including the
  electronic and magnetic properties of the material. It also provides a choice
  of three protocols that pre-configure many calculation settings, balancing
  speed with accuracy.
  <div class="alert alert-success">Select the <b>fast</b> protocol</div>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    Note: Due to the limited resources provided for the demo server, we select
    the <b>fast</b> protocol to reduce the cost of the calculation.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="advanced-settings">
  The Advanced settings allow you to finely tune the calculation.
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    In this walkthrough, we will not modify advanced settings and proceed with
    the defaults.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="bands-settings">
  Here we configure the settings for computing the band structure.
  <div class="alert alert-success">Check <b>Fat bands calculation</b></div>
</div>

<div id="pdos-settings">
  Here we configure the settings for computing the projected density of states,
  or PDOS.
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    In this walkthrough, we will not modify pdos settings and proceed with the
    defaults.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="submission-step">
  In this step, we define the resources to be used in the calculation. The
  global resources are used to define resources across all workflow
  calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource settings for specific
  calculations.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Select computational resources</li>
      <li>Add a description of the calculation</li>
      <li>Click <b>Submit</b> to proceed</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="results-step">
  In this step, we can monitor the calculation and view its results. A summary
  of calculation parameters is also provided. Raw input and output files may be
  downloaded, as well as an AiiDA archive containing the full calculation
  provenance.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the process tree, click on the root <code>QeAppWorkChain</code> node
      </li>
      <li><b>(optional)</b> review the calculation parameters</li>
      <li>Click on the <b>Final Geometry</b> tab</li>
      <li>
        When the structure relaxation is finished, click on
        <b>Load results</b> to view the final structure geometry
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the last two steps for the <b>Bands</b> and <b>PDOS</b> tabs
