# AiiDAlab Quantum ESPRESSO application

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/aiidalab/aiidalab-qe/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/aiidalab/aiidalab-qe)

## About

This is a early-development implementation of an AiiDAlab application for Quantum ESPRESSO workflow.
The app allows the execution of a workflow with Quantum ESPRESSO that includes the selection of an input structure, its relaxation, and the bands structure calculation.

**The app is currently in an early development stage!**

## For developers

The package uses pre-commit hooks to check the style consistency of all commits.
To use those you need to first install the pre-commit package itself, e.g. with:
```
pip install .[dev]
```
and then install the pre-commit hooks with
```
pre-commit install
```
The pre-commit checks should now be automatically executed prior to each commit.

To run unit tests in the AiiDAlab container, you need to run `pytest` from within the `aiida-core-services` conda environment:
```
conda activate aiida-core-services
pytest -sv tests
```

## For maintainers

To create a new release, clone the repository, install development dependencies with `pip install '.[dev]'`, and then execute `bumpver update`.
This will:

  1. Create a tagged release with bumped version and push it to the repository.
  2. Trigger a GitHub actions workflow that creates a GitHub release.

Additional notes:

  - Use the `--dry` option to preview the release change.
  - The release tag (e.g. a/b/rc) is determined from the last release.
    Use the `--tag` option to switch the release tag.
