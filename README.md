# AiiDAlab Quantum ESPRESSO application

## About

This is a early-development implementation of an AiiDAlab application for Quantum ESPRESSO workflow.
The app allows the execution of a workflow with Quantum ESPRESSO that includes the selection of an input structure, its relaxation, and the bands structure calculation.

**The app is currently in an early development stage!**

## For developers

The package uses pre-commit hooks to check the style consistency of all commits.
To use those you need to first install the pre-commit package itself, e.g. with:
```
pip install .[dev]
```
and then install the pre-commit hooks with
```
pre-commit install
```
The pre-commit checks should now be automatically executed prior to each commit.
