How to upgrade or uninstall the app
===================================

On the home page, apps with available updates will state "Update available" in blue at their top right corner. Otherwise, it will read "Latest version" in green.
If desired, upgrading the Quantum ESPRESSO app can be achieved via the App Manager tool or the built-in terminal. Uninstalling the app may be done using the same tools. See the following tabs for more information.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: App Manager

      .. grid:: 1
         :gutter: 3

         .. grid-item-card:: **Step 1: Open the app management page**

            Click on the **Manage App** button to open the app manager.

         .. grid-item-card:: **Step 2: Upgrade or uninstall the app**

            A green :fa:`arrow-circle-up` **Update** button indicates that a newer version is available. Click it to upgrade the app. Alternatively, you may choose to uninstall the app by clicking on the red :fa:`trash` **Uninstall** button.

            .. image:: ../_static/images/app-management-upgrade-available.png

            .. note::

               By default, the app will be upgraded to the latest available version. Alternatively, you can select any available version including versions lower than the currently installed one.

   .. tab-item:: Terminal

      .. grid:: 1
         :gutter: 3

         .. grid-item-card:: You can upgrade the app from the built-in terminal with

            .. code-block:: console

               $ aiidalab install quantum-espresso

            This will install the most recent version of an app, regardless of whether it is already installed or not. You will be prompted to confirm the operation.

         .. grid-item-card:: You can install a specific version by using standard `PEP 440 version specifiers`_, for example:

            .. code-block:: console

               $ aiidalab install quantum-espresso==v22.01.0

         .. grid-item-card:: You can uninstall the app from the built-in terminal with

            .. code-block:: console

               $ aiidalab uninstall quantum-espresso

            Again, you will be prompted to confirm the operation.
