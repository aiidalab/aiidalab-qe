Plugin Registry
=========================================

If you are either in the process of creating a new plugin or already have one developed, you're encouraged to register your plugin here to become part of the official AiiDAlab Quantum ESPRESSO App plugin ecosystem.

Registering Your Plugin
-----------------------

To include your plugin in the registry, follow these steps:

1. Fork this `repository <https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-qe>`_.

2. Add your plugin to the `plugins.yaml` file. Place your entry at the end of the file, following this example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      Top-level key:
        title: "Description to show on top"
        description: "Quantum ESPRESSO plugin for XYZ by AiiDAlab."
        author: "Alice Doe"
        github: "https://github.com/alicedoe/aiidalab-qe-xyz"
        documentation: "https://aiidalab-qe-xyz.readthedocs.io/"
        pip: "aiidalab-qe-xyz==version-of-the-code"
        post-install: "post-install-command"

3. Submit a Pull Request. Direct it to `this repository's Pull Requests section <https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-qe/pulls>`_.

Plugin Entry Requirements
-------------------------

**Required Keys**

- **Top-level key:**   The plugin's distribution name, which should be lowercase and prefixed by ``aiidalab-`` or ``aiida-``. For example, ``aiidalab-qe-coolfeature`` or ``aiidalab-neutron``.
- **title:** Brief title to show on top of the plugin entry. Should contain the main properties we can compute with the given plugin.
- **description:** A brief description of your plugin. Can include more verbose informations with respect to the title.

**Optional Keys**

- **github:** If provided, this should be the URL to the plugin's GitHub homepage.

At least one of ``github`` or ``pip`` is required. ``pip`` installation will be preferred if both are provided, and "==version-of-the-code" can be omitted (but strongly suggested, to ensure compatiblity).

- **pip:** The PyPI package name for your plugin, useful for installation via pip. Example: ``aiida-quantum``.
- **documentation:** The URL to your plugin's online documentation, such as ReadTheDocs.
- **author:** The developer of the plugin.
- **post-install:** a post install Command Line Interface (CLI) command which should be defined inside your plugin if you needs it. For example in the ``aiidalab-qe-vibroscopy`` plugin, we automatically setup the phonopy code via this command. See below for more explanations.

How to define a post install command in your plugin
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you need to run a post-install command, you can define it in the CLI of your package. The command should be designed to be run as ``package-name post-install-command``.
To define the CLI, you can use the ``__main__.py`` file in your source folder and the ``pyproject.toml`` file. You can refer to the `aiidalab-qe-vibroscopy <https://github.com/mikibonacci/aiidalab-qe-vibroscopy>`_ plugin for an example of how to do this.
In that plugin, the automatic setup for the phonopy code is implemented. It assumes that the ``phonopy`` binary is already present on the machine, as the plugin will install it as a dependency.
The post-install command will be triggered after the installation of the plugin (only) from the plugin list page of the Quantum ESPRESSO app.
