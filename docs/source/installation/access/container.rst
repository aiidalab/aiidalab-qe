Local Docker Instance
=====================

.. note::

   If you used another method to access AiiDAlab, you may proceed to :doc:`install the app </installation/install>`.

We provide an AiiDAlab Docker image extension with the Quantum ESPRESSO app pre-installed and ready for use. To run a local container instance from this image, please follow the instructions on the `AiiDAlab documentation <https://aiidalab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/access/index.html>`_ page, making sure to replace the ``aiidalab/full-stack`` image with ``aiidalab/qe``.
