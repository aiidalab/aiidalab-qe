Local Docker Instance
=====================

.. note::

   If you used another method to access AiiDAlab, you may proceed to :doc:`install the app </installation/install>`.

We provide an AiiDAlab Docker image extension with the Quantum ESPRESSO app pre-installed and ready for use. The installation instructions are mostly identical to the general instructions available on the `AiiDAlab documentation <https://aiidalab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/access/index.html>`_ page. You only need to **replace** ``aiidalab/full-stack`` **with** ``ghcr.io/aiidalab/qe`` **when referencing the image** to use.

When complete (AiiDAlab is running in your browser), return here and proceed to :doc:`launch the app </installation/launch>`.

.. note::

   When using this method to access AiiDAlab, the app will be pre-installed in the container and ready for use. No need to visit the *install the app* page.
