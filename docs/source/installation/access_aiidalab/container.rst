========================
Local Container Instance
========================

.. note::

   If you already have access to AiiDAlab but the Quantum ESPRESSO app is not installed, you need proceed to :doc:`install the app </installation/install>`.

AiiDAlab is available as a Docker container - a self-contained, pre-configured environment including all the necessary software to access the AiiDAlab platform.
We also provide container that includes the Quantum ESPRESSO app installed and ready to use.
To run the container, you first need to install Docker on your local machine.
If you have yet to do so, you may click `here <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker>`_ to follow the official Docker installation guide.

We recommended to install the `Docker Desktop <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/>`_ which is available for all major operating systems.

.. important::

   On Linux, if the docker is installed by `docker engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`_, you need `root` privileges to perform the `post-installation steps for Docker Engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/>`_. There is **NO NEED** to perform this step if the docker is installed by `docker desktop <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>`_.

Once Docker is installed, you can launch the container in one of several ways depending on your operating system.
This is discussed in the following sections.

Docker Desktop
**************

If you use Windows, this may be the easiest way to launch the container.
For MacOS and Linux, you can also use Docker Desktop, but you may prefer to use the command line interface (CLI), see the next sections.

Comming soon with video tutorial.

AiiDAlab launch
***************

.. important::

   The following steps require a local installation of Docker.
   You can check the docker is properly installed by running ``docker run hello-world`` in the terminal.

`AiiDAlab launch`_ is a thin Docker wrapper which takes care of all the prerequisites to run the AiiDAlab Docker image.
It helps to manage multiple AiiDAlab profiles, each with its own home directory for persistent storage, and allows to easily switch between them.
To use AiiDAlab launch, you will have to

#. Install AiiDAlab launch with `pipx <https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/>`_ (**recommended**):

   .. code-block:: console

      pipx install aiidalab-launch

   or directly with pip

   .. code-block:: console

      pip install aiidalab-launch

#. Set up a new `QE` profile with

   .. code-block:: console

      aiidalab-launch profile add --image aiidalab/qe:latest QE

   At the prompt, enter `n` to skip editing the profile settings.

#. Start AiiDAlab with

   .. code-block:: console

       aiidalab-launch start -p QE

#. Follow the URL on the screen to open AiiDAlab in the browser

.. tip::

   For more detailed help, run

   .. code-block:: console

      aiidalab-launch --help

Profile Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As shown above, you can manage multiple profiles in AiiDAlab launch, e.g., with different home directories or ports. For more information, run

.. code-block:: console

   aiidalab-launch profiles --help

You can inspect the status of all configured AiiDAlab profiles with

.. code-block:: console

   aiidalab-launch status

Using docker CLI directly
*************************

It is not necessary to use AiiDAlab launch to run the AiiDAlab container.
You can also use the docker CLI directly by running

.. code-block:: console

   docker run -p 8888:8888 aiidalab/qe:latest

Follow the URL on the screen to open AiiDAlab in the browser.

.. important::

   If you use the docker CLI directly, the data in the home directory of the container will be lost when the container is deleted. You can use the ``-v`` option to mount a local directory to the container to store the data persistently. For more information, run ``docker run --help``.
